### Why vue-auth-fire
At times it get very irritating when you want to start your new project which is a firebase project in which you have to set *Authentication Flow* **EVERYTIME**.
You have to add **Routes**, **Protect** your routes, create a **Login** & **Register** component, **Style** those component and have a nice **Loading animation**,
**Validate** your login/register form. and much much more.

**So I have Developed a boiler plate which you can easily use in your app**

### Instalation
Create your project using [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
> **IMPORTANT:**  You need to add `vuex` and `vue-router` while setting up the project. Also add [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#vue-cli-install)

This Repository is basically the `src` folder. Now you just have to replace your src folder with this src folder. **And that all**
